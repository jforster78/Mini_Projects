google-homepage


This is a replica of the Google Homepage.  I have learnt how to move elements, how padding and margins worked and feel.

My biggest frustration was in the footer and how to transform 2 lists in to inline and then float one left and the other to float right, as the one
I kept floating to the right would reverse the order of the list.  I over came that through research and found the list-style-type selector in CSS and 
setting the value to none in the footer ul.

Great experience.  Really enjoyed the task and it looks good.
